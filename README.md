## `shelf` class
Assuming the class is to be a `Stack`,

1. `add_movie`: post-increment `movie_count` and use its old value to index into the array to set the value.
1. `remove_movie`: pre-decrement `movie_count` and use its new value to index into the array to set the value.

Tests prior to error checking:

### Trapping the error in `main` versus the calling function
Letting the exception be handled in `main` allows you to handle it however you wish every time it is invoked. If the exception was instead handled in the function, the corresponding `catch` would always run the same code â€” no matter the situation.
