The cat chased the mouse. The cat ran fast. The mouse ran faster. The cat jumped. 
The dog barked. The dog chased the cat. The cat climbed. The dog waited. The mouse hid. 
The cat looked. The dog barked again. The cat meowed. The mouse squeaked. The dog howled. The cat sat. The dog sat. 
The cat slept. The dog slept. The mouse crept. The mouse crept quietly. The cat dreamed. The dog snored. The mouse escaped.
